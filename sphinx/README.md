# Project Sphinx
The word sphinx comes from the Greek Σφίγξ, apparently from the verb σφίγγω (sphíngō), meaning "to squeeze", "to tighten up".

# Overview
Project Sphinx, utilizes GAMADV-X, a free open source command line tool for Google G Suite Administrators to manage domain and user settings quickly and easily. This tools development is for the purpose of managing file permissions/sharing, by administrators, security operations, and Google G Suite Administrators.

# Direction
In the event that a user/group shares sensitive information via Google Drive, GAM users would benefit from having the ability to assess/contian folder/file share permissions without owner intervention.
